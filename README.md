We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience while using our application. We want to inform you that our backend is hosted on a free cloud application platform called Render. Due to the nature of the free service, there may be occasional delays or slower response times, especially during actions like logging in, as it may take some time for the initial connection to the server to occur.

Please be patient if you encounter any delays during these actions, as the server resources and performance are limited in the free hosting environment. We understand that this may not provide the optimal user experience, and we apologize for any inconvenience it may cause.

We appreciate your understanding and thank you for using our application.
