We apologize for any inconvenience you may experience while using our
application. We want to inform you that our backend is hosted on a free cloud
application platform called Render. Web Services on the free instance type are
automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a
free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request.

This will cause a delay in the response of the first request after a period of
inactivity while the instance spins up.

Please be patient if you encounter any delays during these actions, as the
server resources and performance are limited in the free hosting environment. We
understand that this may not provide the optimal user experience, and we
apologize for any inconvenience it may cause.

We appreciate your understanding and thank you for using our application.
